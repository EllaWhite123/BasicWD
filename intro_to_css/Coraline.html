        <h2>Why Coraline is Great</h2>
        <p>Coraline is an iconic film known by many for it's pleasing visuals and creepy aesthetic. As one of the millions 
            of Coraline fans, I have watched this film since childhood and it has always left a lasting impression on me. But 
            for some, this childhood classic is viewed as being "too scary for kids". Although the film recieved mixed reviews 
            from the parents and children who viewed it, it is considered a cult film masterpiece to this day. Not for the cute 
            and cuddly feeling you probably don't get from watching it. Most do not undertsand that the film is simply meant 
            to be a children's horror. </p>

        <p>What better way to introduce a child to their first horror film could there be?</p>
