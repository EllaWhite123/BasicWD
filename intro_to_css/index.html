        <h3>Spoiler Alert!</h3>

        <p>Let's be honest, if you haven't seen the movie by now, you can't possibly be worried about spoilers. That being said, let's get into the movie!</p>

        <p>Like I said, the movie begins with Coraline arriving to her new home in The Pink Palace appartment complex. As she explores her new environment, she searches for an old well. Along the way she is spooked by the feeling of being eatched when she bumps into her new neighbor, Wybie. She finds out that Wybie's grandmother is the owner of her new home and discovers that she usually doesn't rent to anyone who has children. The reason why is quite sinister as the viewer comes to find out why.
        When Wybie's grandmother was just a girl, her sister disappeared mysteriously while living in the house. This foreshadows the geat evil that lurks within the home. Wybie later leaves a gift on Coralines door step. A doll that looks identical to her that he found in his grandmothers trunk.</p>

    <p>As the movie continues, Coraline investigates the inside of her new home by order of her negligent parents as it pours rain outside. She soon finds a small locked door hidden on the wall. With a button shaped key, her mother reveals that behind the door there is nothing but a brick wall on the other side. Dissappointed, Coraline 
        goes to bed. At the sound of mice squeeking, she awakes and follows them as they scurry to the small door. However, this time there would be no brick wall on the other side but a tunnel to another world. Coraline crawls through curiously with a glint in her eye only to be confused when she reaches the other side. It seems as though she ended up right back in the same room. She notices a mouth watering smell and a soothing singing voice coming from the kitchen. She calls put to her mother whom she beleives to be standing with her back turned before her asking why she is up cooking so late. 
        As her "mother" turns to face her, Coraline quickly realizes that it is not her mother, for the woman standing in the kitchen had buttons for eyes. Coraline stammers "your'e not my mother. My mother does'nt have-" the woman cuts her off "Buttons!". She then explains to Coraline that she is her "other mother". Coraline, fascinated by this alternate reality, continues to return throughout the film until the other mother's ture intentions are revealed. It is too late for Coraline to return to her true home, for the other mother has trapped her in the alternate reality. Coraline manges to escape with the help of the other world's Wybie.
        Her battle does not end there. Once returned Coraline realizes her parents ahve been stolent from her by the other mother in order to lure her back into her hungry arms. With no other option, Coraline returns to the other world to rescue her parents and the ghosts of the past children the other mother has eaten. Coraline outmarts the other mother and saves her parents and her friends.©</p>
