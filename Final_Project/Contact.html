                <h1>Spooky tunes!</h1>
                <p>The feelings we get when hearing our favorite halloween song from Thriller to The Monster Mash, is indescribably comforting. When these songs begin to play, you can practically smell the crisp fall leaves and pumpkin pie already.</p>
         
                <p>Halloween would simply not be the same without some spooky, on-theme music playing. When we're getting ready with our friends for those fun Halloween parties in our favorite Halloween costumes, we're going to need something to really get us into the spirit. Plus, those frightening scenes in some classic Halloween movies wouldn't be what they were without that iconic music in the background!</p>
