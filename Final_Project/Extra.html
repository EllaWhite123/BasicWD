                <h1>Trick or Treating!</h1>
                <p>You trick-or-treat. You get candy. It’s how the deal works.

                    Candy isn’t just relegated to kids, though. Adults can share in the candied fun—a “tax,” if you will. Don’t abstain just because you’re older!
                    
                    And not everyone gives out the normal stuff—those tiny candy bars the size of a quarter, accompanied by a couple rolls of sweet tarts. Some more generous givers dole out treats as varied as juice boxes, giant candy bars, themed goody bags, marshmallows, and even money. And oh—those candied apples are the best.
                    
                    Others give out more practical things, like erasers, pencils, paper and pens. Don’t fault them. They know not what they do.
                    
                    But in all seriousness, Halloween is a great time for getting all sorts of goodies, and then for going home and splurging for the next few days.
                    
                    Just be careful not to overdo it. Your tongue will be quite happy. Your stomach won’t.</p>
