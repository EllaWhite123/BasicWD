                <h2>Dive into the Character of Peta mellark</h2>
                <p>Peta is part of the semi wealthier class of district 12 due to his family owning a bakery. This however has not stopped him from being undeniably in love with the poor Katniss everdeen. He has watched her since they were small and his love carried out throughout all the books. He is described as being a charming, kind, handsome young man with a heart of gold. Not to mention he has a way with the crowd when being seen on television. Peta would do anything for Katniss, despite the constant rejection he faces from the clueless girl.</p>
