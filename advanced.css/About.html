                <h1>A Deep Dive Into Katniss Everdeen's Character</h1>
                <p>Katniss is a 16 year old hunter in the poorest town in the poorest district of Panem. Although hunting is illegal, she finds ways to do so in secret due to her mother being mentally unavailable to take care of her and her young sister because of a horrible accident that resulted in the death of their father. Katniss is the sole provider of her family with the help of her friend Gale. All she cares about in the world is making sure those she loves are safe. This is a big part of her character which is made very aparent when she volunteers at the reaping to save her young sister.</p>
                <img src="images/katniss.back.jpg" alt="Katniss">
                <p>Katniss is an unreliable narrator. She is described as being naive and easily manipulated and she is aware of it which is why she is also very mistrusting in others. She is even completely oblivious to the two main characters who are both madly in love with her and is flabbergasted when she is informed of this.</p>
